<h2>Goals</h2>
The Mentok Build System is a ground-up re-write of the make files used by
portions of Recourse Technologies Inc. and Symantec and engineering.
For historical reasons, the Mentok Build system is also know and refered 
to as "Build3" or "Build System 3.0" for historical reasons, since it
marked the thrid iteration of these make files. These make files have
been released under a suitable public license to foster their adoption,
garner public feedback and enhancements, and provide feedback to other
projects in areas where Mentok stresses other tools to the breaking point
(most notably, Gnu Make).

The primary goals of this re-write are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>De-tangle and document how things such as compiler and linker
       flags are actually generated. It should be easy to figure out
       and change what compiler and compiler options
       are used to compiler or link any given target, and it should
       be easy to modify these on a per-target basis without
       effecting the whole component.

  <li>Clean up macro naming. This is being done simply to further the
       ends of build system maintainability in the future by using
       macro names that not only describe what data is in the macro, but
       provide hints as to its intended usage and origin in the build
       system.

  <li>Introduce a modular design. It should be easy to add the ability
       to provide new pattern rules for 3rd party pre-processors, profiling
       tools, etc. Such additions to the build system should not
       require modification of unrelated rules.

  <li>Centralize build system source code repository. There simply
       isn't a single good reason for every component to maintain
       a copy of make code that is 99% held in common.

  <li>Component chain reporting. Time has been wasted in the past debugging
       problems in one component that turned our to be a bug in an imported
       component that was fixed some time ago; while component chain
       reporting does not prevent this problem, it can make debugging it
       easier. With no dependency reporting between components it's not
       even always obvious what code is being shipped in a given component
       or product.

       
</ul>

<p>

Also, the following goals were explicitly excluded from
this build system re-write:
<ul>
  <li>Backward compatibility. Confused macro naming, directory space
       collisions, and other issues lead to the decision to drop
       backward compatibility with old makefiles. Migration shouldn't
       be hard, but must be done by hand.
</ul>

<h2>Starting a new component tree with the Mentok Build System</h2>
Installing a new component with Mentok is fairly easy, but not as easy is it
really should be. Accomplishing the goal of centralized Mentok source management
requires that either that all components share a source repository capable 
of modularized checkouts such that different components can be checked out 
with Mentok source from a common repository location, or that Mentok be 
published from the source repository to a well known location that other components
can reference. These approaches can be adopted simultaneously by different
components depending on individual component needs and source code management.
<p>
The first approach provides a streamlined building
procedure, but requires careful tag, branch, and module management of
the Mentok system in the source repository to make sure that
modifications propagated back to the Mentok repository from the
needs of components do not break features or usage semantics of Mentok
needed by other components. This approach places a higher burden on
release engineering and the maintainers of Mentok to be careful
in making changes, but is very easy on individual component developers.
Due to realities of source code management on site, we do not
employ this approach at this time.
<p>
The 2nd approach has less of a problem with Mentok
modification collisions since an external publishing mechanism is expected
to version or date-stamp static snap snots of Mentok, but burdens the component
using Mentok with a Mentok "bootstrapping" before the normal build process
can be performed in the given component tree. The component repository and
the "import/dist" mechanisms provided by the "component" Mentok module
(documented below) provide a convenient mechanism for managing the
Mentok repository in this manor at the bootstrapping cost of what
amounts to a recursive copy command that must be executed after
component check out and prior to normal component development builds.
To make this process easier, a boiler plate component tree with
basic Mentok configuration files and code to bootstrap the Mentok system
from a component repository with a layout consistent with the
tools provided by the "Component" Mentok module is provided in
the "build3/bootstrap" directory of any already bootstrapped component
or copy of Mentok in the component repository.
See the <a href="./component/component.html">"Component"</a>
Mentok module's documentation for details on the component repository
and related pattern targets.
<p>
Regardless of which method is used to attach a given version
of Mentok to a component tree, the layout of a component tree
should be fairly uniform.  The following component tree
layout encompasses both the strict requirements of the Mentok system, and 
serves as a reference to what is considered to be "best practices"
by the developers of Mentok. Use of the terms "MUST", "MUST NOT",
"SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT" are to be interpreted as they are
in IETF RFCs.

The directory in which the Mentok system should be installed for use

"BS_ROOT" by all leaf Makefiles. The name "build3" and location directly
under the <i>&lt;Component&nbsp;root&gt;</i> are not strict requirements of
Mentok, but represent standard and historical convention.
<p>
Component developers should not have to modify the contents of this
directory.  In component trees where Mentok is attached via a bootstrapping
mechanism external to the component's source code repository, this
directory MUST NOT be checked into the components source code repository.
In these cases it is considered a best practice to tell your source code
revision control system to ignore this directory. (e.g.: If you are using
CVS to manage <i>&lt;Component&nbsp;root&gt;</i>, you can add an entry to
<i>&lt;Component&nbsp;root&gt;</i>/.cvsignore to ignore this directory.)

Top level Makefile. For the most part this Makefile behaves
exactly as any other leave Makefile in the component tree,

<p>
By convention all import targets for a component are handled in
this makefile. By further (and somewhat vestigial) convention
the details of import targets are not directly defined in this Makefile,
but specified in a separate imports.mk file that is included into this
Makefile.
<p>
Components that require a bootstrapping of Mentok can also include
custom rules in this Makefile to facilitate auto-bootstrapping
by taking advantage of some of the features of gnu make. Examples of
such rules are included in the "build3/bootstrap/Makefile" boiler
plate.

A stand alone Makefile that does not use the Mentok system
at all, but rather provides simple "all" and "clean" targets
to bootstrap Mentok in component trees that require this step.
This Makefile is intentionally small and simplistic, and is not
considered part of Mentok proper since bootstrapping is
considered an extra-Mentok activity that is forced onto
some component trees by a particular source code control
environment. Even so, this file is included in the
boiler plate component tree as reference Mentok bootstrapping code.
<p>
This file is not required in component trees that do not
require a bootstrapping step.  In components that do
require a bootstrapping step it is merely considered
a best practice to include this small makefile to accomplish
it. Other bootstrapping means may be more appropriate in
some environments.

Component wide configuration file. Mentok includes make definitions
from this file or any file this file includes before evaluating any
pattern rules in leaf Makefiles throughout the whole component tree.
This is the expected location for a component to globally override Mentok
defaults such as compiler flags, default build attributes such as
optimization of native code, etc.
<p>
This is also the appropriate location for a component to define named
build variants which can be build concurrently on a given platform
via component defined controls leveraging the functionally implied by
the <a href="base/base.html">"Base"</a> module's "BS_VTAG" control macro.
For example, a component could use the macro "MY_COMPONENT_VARIANT" to
select different Mentok configurations, and set the "BS_VTAG" to permit
these variant to coexist in a developer's component tree.
<p>
The following sample <i>&lt;Component&nbsp;root&gt;</i>/build3-config/defines.mk
should give you an idea of how much the behavior of the core Mentok modules
can be controlled with a few lines of make code.
