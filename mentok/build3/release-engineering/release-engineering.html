<h1>Build System Release Engineering Module</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Release Engineering module of the build system provides
a translation layer between release engineering's
automated build stripts and core targets of the build
system.

<h2>Macros and Controls</h2>

<dl>
  <dt><b>DISTTAG</b></dt>
  <dd>
       This macro is used to set the value of COMPONENT_DISTTAG, and is
       provided as a translation layer between release engineering make
       calling conventions and the architecure and naming conventions of the
       current build system.
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b>NC_CONTROL_STRIP</b></dt>
  <dd>
       This macro is used to set the value of NC_CONTROL_STRIP, and is
       provided as a translation layer between release engineering make
       calling conventions and the architecure and naming conventions of the
       current build system.
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b>NC_CONTROL_DEBUG</b></dt>
  <dd>
       This macro is used to set the value of NC_CONTROL_DEBUG, and is
       provided as a translation layer between release engineering make
       calling conventions and the architecure and naming conventions of the
       current build system.
       </dd><p>

<hr>
<a name="all">
<h2>all</h2>
<h3>all Overview</h3>
Simple target used by release engineering to
perform the bulk of the build for a component. This
is equivalent to the "target" target of the core build system.

<hr>
<a name="package">
<h2>package</h2>
<h3>package Overview</h3>
Simple target used by release engineering to
stage the packaging of a component build and is performed only after
the "all" target has been built.  This is equivalent to the "packaging_packagedir"
and "packaging_packagefile"
targets of the core build system provided by the packaging module.

<hr>
<a name="dist">
<h2>dist</h2>
<h3>dist Overview</h3>
Simple target used by release engineering to push a component build
to the component repository (the dist area). "dist" is
only a valid target once a "package" target has been built. 
This is equivalent to the "component_dist"
target of the core build system provided by the component module.

<hr>
<a name="imports">
<h2>imports</h2>
<h3>imports Overview</h3>
Simple target used by release engineering to import a component
build's import dependancies from
the component repository (the dist area). "imports" must be
done before "all" can be built, and will be done automaticly by
a the building of an "all" target.
This is equivalent to the "component_import"
target of the core build system provided by the component module.


<hr>
<a name="releaseeng_info">
<h2>releaseeng_info</h2>
<h3>releaseeng_info Overview</h3>
Simple target to display information about the macro
settings of all global macros used by the release engineering module of
the build system. The <b>releaseeng_info</b> target will be 
built during the "info" phase of a build, and can be built in 
isolation by requesting the <b>releaseeng_info</b> target.

<hr>
<a name="releaseeng_man">
<h2>releaseeng_man</h2>
<h3>releaseeng_man Overview</h3>
Simple target to display usage information and help pertaining to 
the release engineering module of the build system.
The <b>releaseeng_man</b> target will be built during the "man"
phase of a build, and can be built in isolation by requesting
the <b>releaseeng_man</b> target.

<h2>Example Makefile</h2>
<bloclquote><pre><tt>
# The source root of this component
COMPONENT_ROOT=../..

# The root of the build system
BS_ROOT=$(COMPONENT_ROOT)/../build3

# Boostrap Build system definitions.
include $(BS_ROOT)/defines.mk



# Finally, include the rules to make the build system go.
