Eliminate most system calls - let's try to use perl exclusively and stop
calling out to shells, repeatedly. This will increase our need for 3rdparty
and not standard Perl modules, but so be it. 

We should also up our perl requirements from the not documented 5.005 to 
something a bit newer. 

Need to eliminate a lot of the web junk from the cmdline spinning harness -
I think that can be integrated more cleanly elsewhere. 

File::Copy::Recursive (Fix up our cp'ing)
File::Path (Fix up our mkdir's)

Net::Ping (with syn or with Net::Ping::External)

Sys::Hostname
POSIX::uname();
 ($sysname, $nodename, $release, $version, $machine) = POSIX::uname();

Date replacement. use 'perldoc -f localtime' calls - cache it
