component/group -- helper Makefiles for building the "group-*" meta-components

The meta-component's src/Makefile should define the following:

ENABLED_SLAVES:
	A list of all slave components that we will bundle together as part
	of this meta-component

DISABLED_SLAVES:
	An explicit list of slaves that are NOT being built.  This is
	provided merely as a convenience for when a specific slave is not
	built on all architectures - you can just optionally add them to
	DISABLED_SLAVES instead of ENABLED_SLAVES and not worry about
	changing any dependencies

xxx_PKGSUBDIR:
	Most components will automatically make their own subdirectory inside
	the target directory of their "make package" target (for example
	component "qsp" will make a TARGET_DIR/qsp directory where it places
	its files)  For the rare components that don't do this (ex: mhjava)
	an explicit subdirectory must be set using this directive

Also, you must define explicit dependency rules in order to ensure that
each slave component is built in the correct order.
For example:

	$(BDIR)/datastruct: $(BDIR)/rthread $(BDIR)/base64

to indicate that "datastruct" must be built after both "rthread" and "base64"
