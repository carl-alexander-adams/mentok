<h1>Build System Base Module</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Build System Base Module provides the build
system with basic macros and system information
that should be sufficient for bootstrapping
other build system modules. This information
can also be used by build system users to
make platform adjustments in their build targets.

<hr>
<h2>Macros and Controls</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><b>BS_ROOT</b></dt>
  <dd>
       This macro MUST be set in every Makefile, and indicates
       the location of the build system directory, typically "build3".
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b>COMPONENT_ROOT</b></dt>
  <dd>
       This macro MUST be set in every Makefile, and indicates
       the root location of the source tree of the component
       using the build system.
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b>BS_VTAG</b></dt>
  <dd>
       This macro can be set by products to tag a
       build with a variant name.  Different build variants
       will have their build targets put into different target
       directories, allowing a single build tree to simultaniously
       maintain debug and optimized builds, build with different
       compiler settings, etc. 
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b>BS_ROOT_TARGET_DIR</b></dt>
  <dd>
       This macro is set by the build system and indicates
       the relative path to the root target dir.
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b>BS_ARCH_TARGET_DIR</b></dt>
  <dd>
       This macro is set by the build system and indicates
       the relative path to the architecture specific target
       directory.
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b>BS_NOARCH_TARGET_DIR</b></dt>
  <dd>
       This macro is set by the build system and indicates
       the relative path to the architecture neutral target
       directory.
       </dd><p>

<hr>
<a name="base_targetdirs">
<h2>base_targetdirs</h2>
<h3>base_targetdirs Overview</h3>
Simple target create dirs for targets created
by other build rules.
The <b>base_targetdirs</b> target will be built
during the "pretarget" phase of a build,
and can be built in isolation by requesting the 
<b>base_targetdirs</b> target.


<hr>
<a name="base_nuke">
<h2>base_nuke</h2>
<h3>base_nuke Overview</h3>
Simple target to remove target dirs created
base_targetdirs.
The base_nuke target will be built
during the "nuke" phase of a build,
and can be built in isolation by requesting the 
<b>base_nuke</b> target. The "nuke" build phase
capabilities provided by the base module should
be addaquate for for most modules, freeing
module writers from having to provide their own
commands for the "nuke" build phase.


<hr>
<a name="base_info">
<h2>base_info</h2>
<h3>base_info Overview</h3>
Simple target to display information about the macro
settings of all global macros used by the base module of
the build system. The <b>base_info</b> target will be 
built during the "info" phase of a build, and can be built in 
isolation by requesting the <b>base_info</b> target.

<hr>
<a name="base_man">
<h2>base_man</h2>
<h3>base_man Overview</h3>
Simple target to display usage information and help pertaining to 
the base module of the build system.
The <b>base_man</b> target will be built during the "man"
phase of a build, and can be built in isolation by requesting
the <b>base_man</b> target.

<h2>Example Makefile</h2>
<bloclquote><pre><tt>
# The source root of this component
COMPONENT_ROOT=../..

# The root of the build system
BS_ROOT=$(COMPONENT_ROOT)/../build3

# Boostrap Build system definitions.
include $(BS_ROOT)/defines.mk


#
# Base module provides no pattern targets, so no
# additional macros need be specified in Makefiles.
#


# Finally, include the rules to make the build system go.
include $(BS_ROOT)/rules.mk
