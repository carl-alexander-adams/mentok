<h1>Build System Packaging Module</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Build System Packaging Module provides the
build system with the ability to create various packagings
of files. This includes the ability to create tar files,
zip files, etc. 
<p>
NOTE: Due to limitations in gmake's ability to interpret
generated dependency chains on the fly, making some of
the package targets in a fresh tree may not work in the
first invocation even though the dependencies have been
mapped out. To work around this problem is is recommended
that an 'all' or 'depends' build be invoked separately
before any of the targets provided by this module are
requested.

<hr>
<h2>Macros and Controls</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><b>PACKAGE_ROOT</b></dt>
  <dd>
       The root of the directory for some packaging module targets.
       The default value for this is $(COMPONENT_ROOT)/package.
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b>PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR</b></dt>
  <dd>
       The target directory for some package targets. Package
       targets share a component wide target directory so
       component packages can by built up here piece by piece
       as the build progresses through the component source tree.
       The default value for this is $(PACKAGE_ROOT)/built/$(BS_PLATFORM_ARCH_FULL).
       </dd><p>
  <dt><b>PACKAGE_RELEASE_DIR</b></dt>
  <dd>
       A final staging dir for deliverable tarballs, bundled package, and files.
       The default value for this is $(PACKAGE_ROOT)/release/$(BS_PLATFORM_ARCH_FULL).
       The distinction between this and pushing components to dist is fuzzy.

<h2>PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS</h2>
<h3>PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS Overview</h3>
PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS is the pattern target used to package
files from a build into the component wide package
directory for eventual component roll up. In essence, PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS
is a glorified interface to the file copy command. Only files
may be packaged with this pattern target; directories should be packaged
with the <a href="#PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS">PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS</a>
pattern target.
By default, the file packaged by a given PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS pattern target
will be <i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i> found in either the target
dir for the build system's platform or the default
native code tool chain's target platform. This may be overridden
by the <i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>
<i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>_FROM option.

<p>
PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS will be built during the "posttarget" phase of a build.
PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS may be built in isolation by requesting the "packaging_packagefile"
target.
<h3>PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS Options</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>_DEST</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specifies the file name and path under $(PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR) to copy the
       <i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i> to. This option must specify a
       file location and not a directory. The default value is
       simply <i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>.
       </dd><p>
       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>_FROM</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Override the entire default source path to the
       <i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>. Setting this option
       makes renders the _PLATFORM option moot.
       This option can be used with a <i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>
       to achieve the same behavior provided by the PACKAGE_RAW_TARGETS
       of the old build system.
       </dd><p>
       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>_DEP</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specify additional dependancies for the current target.
       </dd><p>

<a name="PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS">
<h2>PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS</h2>
<h3>PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS Overview</h3>
PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS is the pattern target used to package
directories from a build into the component wide package
directory for eventual component roll up. Only directories
may be packaged with this pattern target; files should be packaged
with the <a href="#PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS">PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS</a>
pattern target.
By default, the directory packaged by a given PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS pattern target
will be <i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i> found in either the target
dir for the build system's platform or the default
native code tool chain's target platform. This may be overridden
by the <i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>
<i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>_FROM option.


<p>
PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS will be built during the "posttarget" phase of a build.
PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS may be built in isolation by requesting the "packaging_packagedir"
target.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>
PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS pattern targets WILL NOT be cleaned by building the "clean" target.
These pattern targets will only be cleaned by building the "nuke" target.
Furthermore, these targets will be remade with every build of the "posttarget" phase.
These are side effects of directory targets potentially overlapping, and of not having
their full contents enumerated to the build system for dependancy resolution.

<h3>PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS Options</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>_DEST</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specifies the directory name and path under $(PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR) to copy the
       <i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i> to. This option must specify a
       directory name. The default value is the basename
       of the current target. If the target already exists, the current
       target will be overlayed into the existing directory.
       </dd><p>

       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>_FROM</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Override the entire default source path to the
       <i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>. Setting this option
       makes renders the _PLATFORM option moot.
       This option can be used with a <i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>
       to achieve the same behavior provided by the PACKAGE_RAW_TARGETS
       of the old build system.
       </dd><p>
       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>_SCRUB</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specifies a list of files or directories to remove from the
       package once it has been copied to the $(PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR).
       This option is useful for cleaning out CVS directories or other
       ancillary files  when packaging directories.
       <b>WARNING:</b>Use of the _SCRUB option for PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS
       may have unintended consequences when multiple targets overlay into
       the same directory.
       </dd><p>
       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>_DEP</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specify additional dependancies for the current target.
       </dd><p>

<a name="TARGZ_TARGETS">
<h2>TARGZ_TARGETS</h2>
<h3>TARGZ_TARGETS Overview</h3>
TARGZ_TARGETS is the pattern target used to create tar'ed and gzip'ed
archive files.
By default, the archive will be created in a file named
$(BS_ARCH_TARGET_DIR)/<i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>.tar.gz, but this
may be overridden by target specific controls.
<p>
TARGZ_TARGETS will be built during the "posttarget" phase of a build.
TARGZ_TARGETS may be built in isolation by requesting the "packaging_targz"
target.
<h3>TARGZ_TARGETS Options</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b><i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>_DEST</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify an override location for the archive file
       produced by the evaluation of the pattern rules.
       The default archive file will be
       $(BS_ARCH_TARGET_DIR)/<i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>.tar.gz,rules,
       but specifying paths under the $(PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR)
       or $(PACKAGE_STAGE_DIR) may be useful for producing
       archive files for final component delivery.
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b><i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>_FILES</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specify a list of files to include in the archive.
       </dd><p>
       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>_MANIFEST</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specify a manifest file containing a list of
       files to include in the archive. The contents
       of the manifest are treated as if they appeared
       in the _FILES option.
       </dd><p>
  <dt><b><i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>_CWD</b></dt>
  <dd>
       The parent directory of the files specified
       by the _FILES or _MANIFEST options. Files
       to appear in a given <i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>
       archive must be located under the directory specified
       by the _CWD option, and will have the _CWD directory
       prefix stripped prior to being placed in the archive.
       The default value for the _CWD option is the
       target directory $(BS_ARCH_TARGET_DIR), but
       it is expected that values containing $(PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR)
       will be useful.

<a name="ZIP_TARGETS">
<h2>ZIP_TARGETS</h2>
<h3>ZIP_TARGETS Overview</h3>
ZIP_TARGETS is the pattern target used to create zip archive files.
By default, the archive will be created in a file named
$(BS_ARCH_TARGET_DIR)/<i>&lt;zip target&gt;</i>.zip, but this
may be overridden by target specific controls.
<p>
ZIP_TARGETS will be built during the "posttarget" phase of a build.
ZIP_TARGETS may be built in isolation by requesting the "packaging_zip"
target.
<h3>ZIP_TARGETS Options</h3>
