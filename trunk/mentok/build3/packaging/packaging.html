<h1>Build System Packaging Module</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Build System Packaging Module provides the
build system with the ability to create various packagings
of files. This includes the ability to create tar files,
zip files, etc. 
<p>
NOTE: Due to limitations in gmake's ability to interpret
generated dependency chains on the fly, making some of
the package targets in a fresh tree may not work in the
first invocation even though the dependencies have been
mapped out. To work around this problem is is recommended
that an 'all' or 'depends' build be invoked separately
before any of the targets provided by this module are
requested.

<hr>
<h2>Macros and Controls</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><b>PACKAGE_ROOT</b></dt>
  <dd>
       The root of the directory for some packaging module targets.
       The default value for this is $(COMPONENT_ROOT)/package.
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b>PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR</b></dt>
  <dd>
       The target directory for some package targets. Package
       targets share a component wide target directory so
       component packages can by built up here piece by piece
       as the build progresses through the component source tree.
       The default value for this is $(PACKAGE_ROOT)/stage/$(BS_PLATFORM_ARCH_FULL).
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b>PACKAGE_RELEASE_DIR</b></dt>
  <dd>
       A final staging dir for deliverable tarballs, bundled package, and files.
       The default value for this is $(PACKAGE_ROOT)/release/$(BS_PLATFORM_ARCH_FULL).
       The distinction between this and pushing components to dist is fuzzy.
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b>PACKAGE_VTAG</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specify a variant tag for package files. This string will be appended to the
       package name for all packages build under the current variant so that differnet
       variants may produce package files with non-overlapping names.
       Currently, only EPM_TARGETS actually make use of this feature.

<a name="PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS">
<h2>PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS</h2>
<h3>PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS Overview</h3>
PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS is the pattern target used to package
files from a build into the component wide package
directory for eventual component roll up. In essence, PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS
is a glorified interface to the file copy command. Only files
may be packaged with this pattern target; directories should be packaged
with the <a href="#PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS">PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS</a>
pattern target.
By default, the file packaged by a given PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS pattern target
will be <i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i> found in either the target
dir for the build system's platform or the default
native code tool chain's target platform. This may be overridden
by the <i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>
<i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>_FROM option.

<p>
PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS will be built during the "posttarget" phase of a build.
PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS may be built in isolation by requesting the "packaging_packagefile"
target.
<h3>PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS Options</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>_DEST</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specifies the file name and path under $(PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR) to copy the
       <i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i> to. This option must specify a
       file location and not a directory, however a directory path may be
       part of this option. (e.g. "/usr/local/bin/foo.exe" is acceptable,
       but "/usr/local/bin" is not.)
       The default value is simply <i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>.
       </dd><p>
       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>_ROOT</b></dt>
  <dd>
       When staging a package file target, substitute this
       path for $(PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR).  Use this with care since
       it may result in files being copied to non-build3 controlled
       directories.  This option is useful for managing release packages
       that are not built by normal build3 release pattern targets like
       EPM_TARGETS.  (See example below).
       </dd><p>
       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>_FROM</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Override the entire default source path to the
       <i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>. Setting this option
       makes renders the _PLATFORM option moot.
       This option can be used with a <i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>
       to achieve the same behavior provided by the PACKAGE_RAW_TARGETS
       of the old build system.
       </dd><p>
       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package file target&gt;</i>_DEP</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specify additional dependancies for the current target.
       </dd><p>
	
</dl>

<hr>
<a name="PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS">
<h2>PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS</h2>
<h3>PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS Overview</h3>
PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS is the pattern target used to package
directories from a build into the component wide package
directory for eventual component roll up. Only directories
may be packaged with this pattern target; files should be packaged
with the <a href="#PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS">PACKAGEFILE_TARGETS</a>
pattern target.
By default, the directory packaged by a given PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS pattern target
will be <i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i> found in either the target
dir for the build system's platform or the default
native code tool chain's target platform. This may be overridden
by the <i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>
<i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>_FROM option.


<p>
PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS will be built during the "posttarget" phase of a build.
PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS may be built in isolation by requesting the "packaging_packagedir"
target.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>
PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS pattern targets WILL NOT be cleaned by building the "clean" target.
These pattern targets will only be cleaned by building the "nuke" target.
Furthermore, these targets will be remade with every build of the "posttarget" phase.
These are side effects of directory targets potentially overlapping, and of not having
their full contents enumerated to the build system for dependancy resolution.

<h3>PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS Options</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>_DEST</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specifies the directory name and path under $(PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR) to copy the
       <i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i> to. This option must specify a
       directory name. The default value is the basename
       of the current target. If the target already exists, the current
       target will be overlayed into the existing directory.
       </dd><p>

       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>_FROM</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Override the entire default source path to the
       <i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>. Setting this option
       makes renders the _PLATFORM option moot.
       This option can be used with a <i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>
       to achieve the same behavior provided by the PACKAGE_RAW_TARGETS
       of the old build system.
       </dd><p>
       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>_SCRUB</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specifies a list of files or directories to remove from the
       package once it has been copied to the $(PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR).
       This option is useful for cleaning out CVS directories or other
       ancillary files  when packaging directories.
       <b>WARNING:</b>Use of the _SCRUB option for PACKAGEDIR_TARGETS
       may have unintended consequences when multiple targets overlay into
       the same directory.
       </dd><p>
       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package dir target&gt;</i>_DEP</b></dt>

<a name="MKDIR_TARGETS">
<h2>MKDIR_TARGETS</h2>
<h3>MKDIR_TARGETS Overview</h3>
MKDIR_TARGETS is the pattern target used to create empty directories 
in the component wide package directory for eventual component roll up. 
By default, the directory created by a given MKDIR_TARGETS pattern target
will be <i>&lt;mkdir target&gt;</i>.  This may be overridden
by the <i>&lt;mkdir target&gt;</i>
<i>&lt;mkdir target&gt;</i>_DEST option.

<p>
MKDIR_TARGETS will be built during the "posttarget" phase of a build.
MKDIR_TARGETS may be built in isolation by requesting the "packaging_mkdir"
target.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>
MKDIR_TARGETS pattern targets WILL NOT be cleaned by building the "clean" target.
These pattern targets will only be cleaned by building the "nuke" target.
Furthermore, these targets will be remade with every build of the "posttarget" phase.
These are side effects of directory targets potentially overlapping, and of not having
their full contents enumerated to the build system for dependancy resolution.

<h3>MKDIR_TARGETS Options</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b><i>&lt;mkdir target&gt;</i>_DEST</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specifies the directory name and path under $(PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR) to create.

<hr>
<a name="EPM_TARGETS">
<h2>EPM_TARGETS</h2>
<h3>EPM_TARGETS Overview</h3>
EPM_TARGETS is the pattern target used to create packages using the epm
utility.  The output from these pattern targets will vary depending
on the options selected and the contents of the EPM list file.
Package files created with EPM_TARGETS will be placed in the 
$(PACKAGE_RELEASE_DIR).  Because the output of an EPM target
may vary, and it is undesirable to create targets that
depend on the results of an EPM target without explicitly knowing what
those results are, EPM targets also generate an output manifest that 
lists the files produced by the successful building of a EPM target.
These output manifests are only created when an EPM target has successfully 
been created, and are suitable for input to component distribution rules. 
(See the <a href="../components/components.html">Components</a>
build module.)  Thie motivation of creating these output manifests is
to discourage subsequent packaging rules that are based on wildcards
or directory searchs; such rules can easilly produce incomplete results
even when they appear to run successfully since their operation is
not guided by an explicit dependency list.
The output manifest file will be placed in the $(BS_ARCH_TARGET_DIR), and
will be named <i>&lt;epm target&gt;</i>-epm.manifest.
<p>
EPM_TARGETS will be built during the "posttarget" phase of a build.
EPM_TARGETS may be built in isolation by requesting the "packaging_epm"
target.
<h3>EPM_TARGETS Options</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b><i>&lt;epm target&gt;</i>_NAME</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify an override package name.
       The default package name will be
       <i>&lt;emp target&gt;</i>.
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b><i>&lt;epm target&gt;</i>_EPMLIST</b>=<i>epm list file</i></dt>
  <dd>
       Specify an override package list file. the default
       epm list file is <i>&lt;emp target&gt;</i>.list.
       </dd><p>
       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;epm target&gt;</i>_FORMAT</b>=<i>package format</i></dt>
  <dd>
       Specify a package format to output. The default is to produce
       epm packages, but native package (such as "rpm") may also be
       specified.
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b><i>&lt;epm target&gt;</i>_ARCH</b>=<i>arch</i></dt>
  <dd>
       Specify that the package should be build for the indicated
       architecture. The default is to build a package for the local architecture.
      </dd><p>
</dl>

<a name="TARGZ_TARGETS">
<h2>TARGZ_TARGETS</h2>
<h3>TARGZ_TARGETS Overview</h3>
TARGZ_TARGETS is the pattern target used to create tar'ed and gzip'ed
archive files.
By default, the archive will be created in a file named
$(PACKAGE_RELEASE_DIR)/<i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>.tgz, but this
may be overridden by target specific controls.
<p>
TARGZ_TARGETS will be built during the "posttarget" phase of a build.
TARGZ_TARGETS may be built in isolation by requesting the "packaging_targz"
target.
<h3>TARGZ_TARGETS Options</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b><i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>_DEST</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify an override location for the archive file
       produced by the evaluation of the pattern rules.
       The default archive file will be

       archive must be located under the directory specified
       by the _CWD option, and will have the _CWD directory
       prefix stripped prior to being placed in the archive.
       The default value for the _CWD option is the
       target directory $(BS_ARCH_TARGET_DIR), but
       it is expected that values containing $(PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR)
       will be useful.

       the root of the archive.  The version string specified in this control macro
       will be used for the contents of this version file. The default is to not embed this file.
       <b>NOTE:</b> it is not automatic that version numbrers are also embedded into the 
       file name of the archive. If the generated archive file should also have a version
       number in it, the target should be created with the version number as part of the
       target name.
