Mentok is an enterprise grade build system designed for release engineering 
automation. Mentok has two primary components: a makefile system known as "build3",
and release engineering automation scripts known as the "build harness".
<p>
The makefile component of Mentok is designed to not require developers to 
understand the finer points  of make (as they never do anyways).  Mentok provides 
project wide build controls but a allows deep degrees of customization per directory or target.  
Mentok makefile system is the opposite of autoconf.  It is designed for consistency of 
compilation over "just working" with whatever tool chain happens to be found
in the environment. 
<p>
The build harness is designed to manage the building and tagging the many diverse
projects found within a typical engineering environment.  It's modular design accommodates
a variety of revision control systems, as well as arbitrary build systems (yes, it supports
more than build3).

The Zen of Make

<br>
When writing makefiles you must clear your mind of the palace you desire.

<br>
Rather, fill your mind with the essence of each stone that you might
possibly use.

<br>
Once you have fully appreciated every stone from the mightyest bolder
to the humblest pebble,

<br>
all you must do is request the palace from your pile of stones, and it will be.
