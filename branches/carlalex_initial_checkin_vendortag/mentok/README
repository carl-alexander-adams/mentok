This is build3 (A.K.A. "Project Mentok"), our third generation make system.
Build3 is intended to be a modular build system implemented with GNU make
version 3.80 or later that is suitable for use in a release engineering
environment. As such, reproducibility, predictability, and insensitivity
to users' environments are prized over automated portability via
probing of the runtime environment.


Contents:

    build3/
        This directory contains the core modules of build3.

    build3-sample-component-tree/
        A sample component source tree that uses build system 3

    src/
        Build system 3 component src tree that uses the copy of
        build system 3 in this dir. This is how build system 3
        packages and publishes itself. (Holy recursion Batman!)
