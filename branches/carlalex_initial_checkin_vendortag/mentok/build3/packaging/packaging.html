<h1>Build System Packaging Module</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Build System Packaging Module provides the
build system with the ability to create various packagings
of files. This includes the ability to create tar files,
zip files, etc. 
<p>
NOTE: Due to limitations in gmake's ability to interpret
generated dependency chains on the fly, making some of
the package targets in a fresh tree may not work in the
first invocation even though the dependencies have been
mapped out. To work around this problem is is recommended
that an 'all' or 'depends' build be invoked separately
before any of the targets provided by this module are
requested.

<hr>
<h2>Macros and Controls</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><b>PACKAGE_ROOT</b></dt>
  <dd>
       The root of the directory for some packaging module targets.
       The default value for this is $(COMPONENT_ROOT)/package.
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b>PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR</b></dt>
  <dd>
       The target directory for some package targets. Package
       targets share a component wide target directory so
       component packages can by built up here piece by piece
       as the build progresses through the component source tree.
       The default value for this is $(PACKAGE_ROOT)/built/$(BS_PLATFORM_ARCH_FULL).
       </dd><p>
  <dt><b>PACKAGE_RELEASE_DIR</b></dt>
  <dd>
       A final staging dir for deliverable tarballs, bundled package, and files.
       The default value for this is $(PACKAGE_ROOT)/release/$(BS_PLATFORM_ARCH_FULL).
       The distinction between this and pushing components to dist is fuzzy.

<h2>PACKAGE_TARGETS</h2>
<h3>PACKAGE_TARGETS Overview</h3>
PACKAGE_TARGETS is the pattern target used to package
files from a build into the component wide package target
dir for eventual component roll up. In essence, PACKAGE_TARGETS
is a glorified interface to the file copy command. Directories or
files may be packaged with this pattern target.
By default, the file packaged by a given PACKAGE_TARGETS pattern target
will be $(BS_ARCH_TARGET_DIR)/<i>&lt;package target&gt;</i>. This may be overridden
by the _PLATFORM and _FROM options.

<p>
PACKAGE_TARGETS will be built during the "posttarget" phase of a build.
PACKAGE_TARGETS may be built in isolation by requesting the "packaging_package"
target.
<h3>PACKAGE_TARGETS Options</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package target&gt;</i>_DEST</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specifies the under $(PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR) to copy the
       <i>&lt;package target&gt;</i> to. If the value of this option
       ends with a "/", the destination is assumed to be a directory
       into which the <i>&lt;package target&gt;</i> will be places,
       otherwise the <i>&lt;package target&gt;</i>will have its name
       changed to the value indicated by this option.
       </dd><p>
       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package target&gt;</i>_PLATFORM</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Override just the platform portion of the full path
       to the <i>&lt;package target&gt;</i> being packaged.
       By default, the platform of a <i>&lt;package target&gt;</i>
       is $(BS_PLATFORM_ARCH_FULL). $(BS_PLATFORM_NOARCH) is probably
       the most useful value that can be assigned to this control.
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b><i>&lt;package target&gt;</i>_FROM</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Override the whole default source path to the
       <i>&lt;package target&gt;</i>. Setting this option
       makes setting the _PLATFORM option pointless.
       This option can be used with a <i>&lt;package target&gt;</i>
       to achieve the same behavior provided by the PACKAGE_RAW_TARGETS
       of the old build system.
       </dd><p>
       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;package target&gt;</i>_SCRUB</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specifies a list of files or directories to remove from the
       package once it has been copied to the $(PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR).
       This option is useful for cleaning out CVS directories or other
       ancillary files  when packaging directories.
       </dd><p>

<a name="TARGZ_TARGETS">
<h2>TARGZ_TARGETS</h2>
<h3>TARGZ_TARGETS Overview</h3>
TARGZ_TARGETS is the pattern target used to create tar'ed and gzip'ed
archive files.
By default, the archive will be created in a file named
$(BS_ARCH_TARGET_DIR)/<i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>.tar.gz, but this
may be overridden by target specific controls.
<p>
TARGZ_TARGETS will be built during the "posttarget" phase of a build.
TARGZ_TARGETS may be built in isolation by requesting the "packaging_targz"
target.
<h3>TARGZ_TARGETS Options</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b><i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>_DEST</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify an override location for the archive file
       produced by the evaluation of the pattern rules.
       The default archive file will be
       $(BS_ARCH_TARGET_DIR)/<i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>.tar.gz,rules,
       but specifying paths under the $(PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR)
       or $(PACKAGE_STAGE_DIR) may be useful for producing
       archive files for final component delivery.
       </dd><p>

  <dt><b><i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>_FILES</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specify a list of files to include in the archive.
       </dd><p>
       
  <dt><b><i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>_MANIFEST</b></dt>
  <dd>
       Specify a manifest file containing a list of
       files to include in the archive. The contents
       of the manifest are treated as if they appeared
       in the _FILES option.
       </dd><p>
  <dt><b><i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>_CWD</b></dt>
  <dd>
       The parent directory of the files specified
       by the _FILES or _MANIFEST options. Files
       to appear in a given <i>&lt;targz target&gt;</i>
       archive must be located under the directory specified
       by the _CWD option, and will have the _CWD directory
       prefix stripped prior to being placed in the archive.
       The default value for the _CWD option is the
       target directory $(BS_ARCH_TARGET_DIR), but
       it is expected that values containing $(PACKAGE_TARGET_DIR)
       will be useful.

<a name="ZIP_TARGETS">
<h2>ZIP_TARGETS</h2>
<h3>ZIP_TARGETS Overview</h3>
ZIP_TARGETS is the pattern target used to create zip archive files.
By default, the archive will be created in a file named
$(BS_ARCH_TARGET_DIR)/<i>&lt;zip target&gt;</i>.zip, but this
may be overridden by target specific controls.
<p>
ZIP_TARGETS will be built during the "posttarget" phase of a build.
ZIP_TARGETS may be built in isolation by requesting the "packaging_zip"
target.
<h3>ZIP_TARGETS Options</h3>
<dl>

       Specify a manifest file containing a list of

       in the _FILES option.

       The parent directory of the files specified
