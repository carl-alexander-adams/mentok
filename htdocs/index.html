Mentok is an enterprise grade build system designed for release engineering 
automation. It is designed to not require developers to understand the finer points 
of make (as they never do anyways).  Mentok provides project wide build 
controls but a allows deep degrees of customization per directory or target.  
Mentok is the opposite of autoconf.  It is designed for consistency of 
compilation over "just working" with whatever tool chain happens to be found
in the environment.

The Zen of Make

<br>
When writing makefiles you must clear your mind of the palace you desire.

<br>
Rather, fill your mind with the essence of each stone that you might
possibly use.

<br>
Once you have fully appreciated every stone from the mightyest bolder
to the humblest pebble,

<br>
all you must do is request the palace from your pile of stones, and it will be.
