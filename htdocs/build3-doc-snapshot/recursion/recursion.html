<h1>Build System Recursion Module</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Build System Recursion Module provides the
build system with the ability to recursively call
make in subdirectories.  Building of recursive
targets is done in a depth first order, with the
order of decent into sibling directories being
determined by the order in which they are specified
in the recursion target SUBDIRS_TARGETS

<h2>SUBDIR_TARGETS</h2>
<h3>SUBDIR_TARGETS Overview</h3>
SUBDIR_TARGETS is the sub-directory targets pattern target.
The build process will execute make in all enumerated 
subdirectories in this target list.
SUBDIR_TARGETS patten targets will be built
during the "recursions" phase of a build,
and cannot be built in isolation. Build directory recursion
is performed depth first in the order directories are
specified in the SUBDIR_TARGETS pattern target.




<h3>SUBDIR_TARGETS Options</h3>
None.

<a name="recursion_info">
<h2>recursion_info</h2>
<h3>recursion_info Overview</h3>
Simple target to display information about the macro
settings of all global macros used by the recursion module of
the build system. The <b>recursion_info</b> target will be 
built during the "info" phase of a build, and can be built in 
isolation by requesting the <b>recursion_info</b> target.

<hr>
<a name="recursion_man">
<h2>recursion_man</h2>
<h3>recursion_man Overview</h3>
Simple targes to display usage information and help pertaining to 
the recursion module of the build system.
The <b>recursion_man</b> target will be built during the "man"
phase of a build, and can be built in isolation by requesting
the <b>recursion_man</b> target.
